# Love_Calculator
This is a repository containing some of the codes for the 'Love Calculator',a play with words many of us had done in our high school days. I first started working on such a program when one of my friends asked for a large data set of such percentage calculations.Later on I made many optimisations to the original code.The original code has not been added to the repository.

The current code has made use some Python modules like: 
1)xlrd(to read data from spreadsheets)
2)tabula-py(to read tabulated data from PDF documents)

Currently working to modify the program to read data directly from CSV files,thus eliminating the use of 'xlrd' module,and using csv module instead which is built-in in Python.

Detailed method of calculation can be found from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFsLVG7EAZ4
